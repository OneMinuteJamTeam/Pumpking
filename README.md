**Pumpking** was created as a submission for the "**One Minute Game Jam**"

## The Game

Our spooky game is short and sweet! 

This is a 2 player game!

Grab a friend and chase each other around our pumpkin patch 🎃

One player starts as the chaser, and the other the runner. The game switches at the half way point and the roles reverse! You will get to experience the fear of running for your life, and the thrill of chasing down your prey all in 1 minute. 

At the start of each game you can choose who will start as their intended role. 

Have fun and Happy Halloween! 👻

## Gameplay

We have created 2 characters. Each character has their own simple ability. 

The scarecrow can push OR pull you away depending on if he is chasing or running away 🏃‍♂️

The pumpkin can dash forward to get away, or catch up! 💨

Around the map you will find 1 Powerup: **The Crown**. 👑

And 1 Trap: **The Flytrap**!

**The Crown** will offer a temporary speed boost for both characters!

**The Flytrap** will trap either character for a short amount of time!
